The Cat Who Adopted Bunnies
This is a true story about a lovely gray and white female cat, Missy, who gave birth to two sickly kittens. 
Sadly, within a very short time, both newborns died. It was heartbreaking to hear Missy crying and calling 
for her babies as she searched the house for her kittens. Missy was an indoor/outdoor cat who liked to hunt 
in a nearby field. Like many female cats, she liked to bring us her catch, and it wasn't unusual for her 
offerings to include mice, birds or chipmunks, sometimes still alive and kicking! One afternoon, she came 
through her basement cat door carefully carrying a very tiny baby bunny by the scruff of its neck.
I happened to see her and took it away unharmed, putting it in a box lined with a soft cloth until I could 
figure out what to do with it. Meanwhile, she went outdoors again and in a few minutes was back with another 
baby bunny. She brought back four of the babies before deciding that was enough. Then she climbed into the box 
next to them and started grooming them and purring, turning on her side trying to entice them to nurse. 
Unfortunately, she no longer had milk to feed them. We could see that these babies would not survive the adoption, 
so we set out to see if we could find the nest and return the bunnies to their birth mother. Eventually, we found 
the nest and set the four adoptees back with their siblings. We kept Missy indoors for the rest of the day and night. 
The next day when we checked the nest, the babies were gone. We believe the mother rabbit moved them to a safer place. 
Our poor frustrated mama cat never tried adopting baby bunnies again.
